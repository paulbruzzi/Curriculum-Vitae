	abstract = {We present a comprehensive and pedagogical study of two core quantum algorithms
				in quantum linear algebra: the Hadamard test (HT) and quantum phase estimation 
				(QPE). Building on Lin's lecture notes on Quantum Algorithms for Scientific 
				Computing, we detail their mathematical formulations, circuit implementations,
				and convergence behavior. Both algorithms are benchmarked on simulators and IBM's
				127-qubit Eagle processor (ibm rensselaer) using a simple eigenvalue problem. While
				QPE performs well in simulation, its hardware performance degrades beyond t = 3
				ancilla qubits due to circuit depth and two-qubit gate noise. In contrast, HT
				shows stable, sampling-based convergence and greater resilience to hardware noise.
				We further apply QPE to the transversefield Ising model (TFIM), demonstrating the
				importance of ansatz quality for accurate ground state energy estimation. These
				results provide a realistic baseline for implementing phase estimation on noisy
				intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era devices.},
